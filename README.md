# ud989-pizzamvo

Basic training files for the pizza project. The aim of this project is to
optimize pagespeed and to learn about the critical rendering path.

The task was to optimize pagespeed above 90 and to get a framerate
above 60 with the moving pizzas.

This is the untouched original repro as a clone.
